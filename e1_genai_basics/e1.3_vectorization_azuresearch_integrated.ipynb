       "    'chunk': \"Contractors \\n\\nOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN \\n\\nHealthcare Providers - Independent Contractors \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Northwind Standard plan includes independent contractors in its network of \\n\\nhealthcare providers. These independent contractors provide services that are covered \\n\\nunder the plan, such as primary care physician visits, specialty care services, and other \\n\\nhealthcare services. Depending on the plan, these independent contractors may also \\n\\nprovide services such as mental health and substance abuse counseling, physical therapy, \\n\\nand home health services.  \\n\\nIt is important for employees to understand that Northwind Standard does not provide \\n\\ncoverage for care received from independent contractors. Employees must pay for these \\n\\nservices out-of-pocket, and any claims for services provided by independent contractors \\n\\nmust be submitted directly to the provider.  \\n\\nWhen seeking care from an independent contractor, it is important for employees to make \\n\\nsure they are aware of any additional fees or restrictions that may apply. For example, some \\n\\nproviders may require a fee for services such as mental health counseling, or may only \\n\\naccept certain types of insurance. It is also important for employees to understand that the \\n\\nprovider may not be able to provide care if the employee does not have the required \\n\\ndocumentation or is unable to pay the required fee.  \\n\\nIn addition, it is important for employees to understand that independent contractors may \\n\\nnot be subject to the same regulations as other healthcare providers. For example, the \\n\\nprovider may not be required to adhere to the same quality standards as other healthcare \\n\\nproviders, and may not be required to be licensed in the state where the services are \\n\\nprovided.  \\n\\nWhen selecting a provider, it is important for employees to make sure they are familiar with \\n\\nthe provider’s policies and procedures. Employees should also make sure they understand \\n\\nany additional costs that may be associated with the services provided by the independent \\n\\ncontractor.  \\n\\nFinally, when selecting a provider, it is important for employees to research the provider’s \\n\\nbackground and credentials. Employees should make sure the provider is properly licensed \\n\\nand certified, and has a good reputation in the healthcare community. Additionally, \\n\\nemployees should make sure the provider is up-to-date on the latest advances in healthcare \\n\\ntechnology and treatments, so they can be sure they are receiving the best possible care.  \\n\\nOverall, when selecting a healthcare provider, it is important for employees to do their \\n\\nresearch and make sure they understand the provider’s policies and procedures, as well as \\n\\nany additional costs that may be associated with the services they provide. Additionally, it is \\n\\nimportant for employees to make sure the provider is properly licensed and certified, and \\n\\nhas a good reputation in the healthcare community. By doing their research and \\n\\nunderstanding the provider’s qualifications and policies, employees can be sure they are \\n\\nreceiving the best possible care. \\n\\nIntentionally False Or Misleading Statements \\n\\nOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN  \\n\\n\\n\\nIntentionally False Or Misleading Statements:  \\n\\nWhen it comes to health insurance, there are unfortunately many companies who make \\n\\nintentionally false or misleading statements about their plans. Northwind Health is no \\n\\nexception. It is important for employees to be aware of any potential inaccuracies or false \\n\\ninformation that Northwind Health may use when discussing their plans. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, it is important to remember that Northwind Standard does not offer \\n\\ncoverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-\\n\\nnetwork services. The Northwind Standard plan provides coverage for medical, vision, and \\n\\ndental services, but does not cover any of the services mentioned. While Northwind Health \\n\\nmay advertise that their plan covers these services, it is important to be aware that they do \\n\\nnot. \\n\\nNorthwind Health may also make claims that their plan covers any type of preventive care \\n\\nservices. While Northwind Standard does cover some preventive care services, it is \\n\\nimportant to remember that they may not cover all preventive care services. It is important \\n\\nto read the plan details in order to determine which preventive care services are covered. \\n\\nIt is also important to be aware that Northwind Health may make claims that their network \\n\\nof in-network providers is comprehensive.

It \\n\\nis important to understand these exclusions so that you can plan your care accordingly.  \\n\\nServices Not Covered:  \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus does not cover services that are not medically necessary, such as \\n\\ncosmetic surgery or elective procedures. Additionally, services or treatments that are \\n\\nexperimental or investigational are not covered under this plan.  \\n\\nPrescriptions Not Covered: The plan does not cover prescriptions that are not medically \\n\\nnecessary, certain over-the-counter medications, or prescription medications that are used \\n\\nto enhance performance in athletics.  \\n\\nMental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment: The plan does not cover mental health or \\n\\nsubstance abuse treatment services provided by a non-network provider or any services \\n\\nthat are not medically necessary. \\n\\nPreventive Care: Northwind Health Plus does not cover preventive care services provided \\n\\nby a non-network provider.  \\n\\nTips for Avoiding Exclusions \\n\\nWhen considering a medical service or treatment, it is important to review the plan's \\n\\nevidence of coverage to ensure that the service or treatment is covered under the plan. You \\n\\nshould also discuss the service or treatment with your doctor to ensure that it is medically \\n\\nnecessary. Additionally, you should review the list of excluded services and prescriptions to \\n\\nensure that you are not seeking treatment for an excluded service or prescription.  \\n\\nIf you are considering a medical service or treatment that is not covered under the plan, you \\n\\nshould discuss payment options with your doctor or healthcare provider. Additionally, you \\n\\nmay need to consider other payment sources, such as private insurance, flexible spending \\n\\naccounts, or state or federal programs. \\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, it is important to understand the plan's coverage limits and to keep track of all out-\\n\\nof-pocket expenses. You should also be aware of your plan's annual deductible and \\n\\ncoinsurance amounts.  \\n\\nBy understanding Northwind Health Plus's exclusions and following the tips outlined above, \\n\\nyou can ensure that you are receiving the most comprehensive coverage available under the \\n\\nplan and avoid any unexpected costs. \\n\\nWHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE? \\n\\nCoordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans \\n\\nWHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE? \\n\\nCoordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans \\n\\nIf you have other health care coverage, such as Medicare or a health plan from another \\n\\nemployer, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus. Coordinating \\n\\nbenefits means that both plans work together to pay for covered services. This coordination \\n\\nhelps to ensure that you don’t pay more than you should for your health care. \\n\\nWhen coordinating benefits, one plan pays first and the other plan pays what is left after the \\n\\nfirst plan has paid. The plan that pays first is called the primary plan, and the plan that pays \\n\\nsecond is called the secondary plan. Generally, the primary plan pays up to the amount of its \\n\\nallowed amount for the services you received. The secondary plan then pays the difference \\n\\nbetween what the primary plan paid and the total cost of the services. \\n\\nThe way in which you coordinate benefits will depend on the type of coverage you have. \\n\\nCoordinating Benefits with Medicare \\n\\nIf you have Medicare, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus. \\n\\nMedicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65 years of age and older, people \\n\\nwith certain disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).

This is because Northwind Health has \\n\\nnegotiated discounted rates with in-network providers.  \\n\\nOut-of-Network Costs: If you use an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for \\n\\npaying the full cost of the services you receive. Additionally, you may have to pay a higher \\n\\ndeductible and coinsurance.  \\n\\nPrescription Drug Costs: Prescription drug costs are also taken into consideration with \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus. Your out-of-pocket costs will depend on the tier of the medication \\n\\nyou are prescribed.

Talk to your doctor and make sure that you \\n\\nhave a plan for delivery and postpartum care that is covered by your insurance.  \\n\\n• Make sure that you understand the newborn screening tests that are covered and any \\n\\nfollow-up treatments or visits that may be required.  \\n\\n• If you are planning to use a birthing facility other than a hospital, make sure that you \\n\\ncheck to see if it is covered under the plan.  \\n\\n\\n\\n• Make sure that you understand the exceptions to coverage, and if you have any questions, \\n\\ncontact Northwind Health directly.  \\n\\n• Be aware that some services, such as elective cosmetic procedures, are not covered under \\n\\nthis plan.  \\n\\n• Contact your doctor or Northwind Health if you have any questions or concerns about the \\n\\ncoverage provided for your newborn. \\n\\nOrthognathic Surgery (Jaw Augmentation Or Reduction) \\n\\nOrthognathic Surgery (Jaw Augmentation or Reduction): \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus covers Orthognathic Surgery, also referred to as Jaw Augmentation \\n\\nor Reduction, as a covered service. This procedure is used to correct irregularities in the jaw \\n\\nand face caused by misalignment of bones or teeth. It is a complex procedure that involves \\n\\ncutting and repositioning the jaw bones to improve the alignment and overall appearance of \\n\\nthe face. \\n\\nOrthognathic Surgery is typically covered when medically necessary and is performed to \\n\\nimprove the functional aspects of the jaw and face.

In some \\n\\ncases, you may need to be referred to a specialist for a more in-depth evaluation. \\n\\nIn some cases, Northwind Health Plus may require pre-authorization for Orthognathic \\n\\nSurgery prior to the procedure being performed. This means that you may need to get \\n\\napproval from Northwind Health Plus before the procedure can be done. Your physician can \\n\\nprovide you with more information about this process. \\n\\nAfter the procedure, your physician may recommend that you wear a protective appliance, \\n\\nsuch as a splint or headgear, to protect your jaw while it heals. You may also need to attend \\n\\nfollow-up appointments with your physician to monitor your progress. \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus typically covers the cost of Orthognathic Surgery, but you should \\n\\nconfirm with your provider that all costs associated with the procedure are covered. \\n\\nAdditionally, you should keep in mind that there may be certain limitations or exclusions'}]}}"

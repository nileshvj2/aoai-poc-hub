This repo contains collection of notebooks which are proof of concepts I have developed using Azure AI services and other LLM models.
Each notebook in this repo provides detailed code walkthrough of important concepts and will teach you how to build Gen AI applications with step by step explainations to understand important concepts.
Intention to create this POC Hub is to share proof of concepts with anyone interested in creating AI solutions!
